    <p>B boys is a punk band based in New York. My friend Bobby 
        (of Joan of Arc), introduced me to them in 2017</p>
    <p>I have booked B Boys to play at State Street Pub here in 
        Indianapolis, I've also seen them in
        Chicago and Toronto.</p>
    <p>Bobby lives in Chicago, so I took a little trip to the city to see the Boys
        play at an outdoor block party in the middle of February called,
        "Music Frozen Dancing". It was a great show! Bobby has known B Boys
        a little long than I have, he invited all of us back to his place after.</p>
